# Improved-LSB-image-steganography-using-MSB-filtering-of-pixels

This is an improved version of existing LSB based image steganography. Total pixels are classified based on the MSB bit filtering into dark pixels and light pixels before encoding and any one type of the pixels are used to hide message. It is being predicted that the proposed technique will provide additional security to the normal image steganography and can able to hide large data in single image.
